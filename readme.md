This is a university project where I developed a tool for computing optimal paths for skitours in backcountry skiing.

It finds an optimal path from point A to B. An optimal path here means a path best suited for a skitour, e.g. traversable, low avalanche risk, efficient, no unnecessary paths not leading directly to the endpoint.

Example path for a segment of a tour. The computed results for uphill (orange) and downhill (purple) are compared to a tour created by a professional. This is on Kreuzspitze in the Alps.

Another example on Osterfelderkopf. The comparsion path here is actually a climbing route, so only partly suited for skiing. Still this route is traversable and shows that the tool might be used for climbing routes as well with adapted parameters.

Some more beautiful topographic map with a path. Here again on Kreuzspitze.

This is a university-only project, Carl Zeiss AG is not invovled commercially in any means. They are mentioned, as they were the sponsor of my studies in the system of co-op studying at DHBW.
